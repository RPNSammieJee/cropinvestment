          <h2>Purpose of our Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>Cropinvestment, Inc. is aware of the trust you place in us and our responsibility to protect your privacy. This privacy policy and agreement (our “Privacy Policy”) specifies the personal information that we ask you to provide in order to participate in the Services we offer and governs how we treat this personal information. We operate our Website and offer our Services pursuant to the statutes and regulations that apply to this Website with respect to the Services provided through this Site (“Applicable Law”).</p>
          <p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. YOUR CONSENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY CREATES LEGAL OBLIGATIONS FOR YOU AND FOR US. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE OUR WEBSITE.</p>
          <p>You indicate your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy in various ways, depending on your use of the services offered by the Website. By accessing and using the Website as a site visitor, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to be legally bound by it. If you register as an Investor on our Website, during the registration process you will be asked to confirm that you have reviewed this Privacy Policy and that you agree to its terms. Such confirmation constitutes your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Policy. You are permitted to register only in your capacity as an individual, and we do not allow Investors to register on behalf of a group or organization.</p>

      <div class="privacy-section">
          <h2>Information You Provide</h2>
          <p>Information you may provide while visiting our Website or while participating in our Services falls into two broad categories: (i) Personally Identifiable Information, and (ii) Anonymous Information. “Personally Identifiable Information” means any information that could reasonably be used to identify you, including your name, address, e-mail address, birth date, financial information, cell or land-line phone number, or any combination of information that could be used to identify you. “Anonymous Information” is information that does not identify you and may include statistical information concerning, for example, your use of our Services or the pages on our Website that you visit most frequently. Please keep in mind that our Privacy Policy does not govern information you choose to share with other Users, as we have no direct control over the collection or use of this information. Please use appropriate precautions in sharing your information with other Users.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="privacy-section">
          <h2>Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
          <p>The Personal Information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your Personal Information. We will also let you know prior to collection whether the provision of the Personal Information we are collecting is compulsory or may be provided on a voluntary basis and the consequences, if any, of not providing the information.</p>
          <p>We obtain Personally Identifiable Information from Investors or other persons who have signed up to participate as an Investor through the Website. In order to access our services as an Investor, you must complete a registration form which specifies the information you must provide in order to enjoy the particular features to which you wish to subscribe. The information required may include such items as name; email address; cell and land-line phone number; mailing address; social security number (for IRS tax reporting purposes); and birth date (for COPPA and eligibility purposes) (collectively "Contact Information"). Our registration forms may additionally request information which you may, at your option, choose to provide or withhold. To the extent this additional information constitutes Personally Identifiable Information, we will treat it in the manner specified in this Privacy Policy. To qualify to invest in Investment Opportunities presented on our Website, you must be an Accredited Investor and provide identity verification information and Investor financial information described below.</p>
          <p><strong>Identity Verification Information:</strong> Each Investor must provide information designed to verify his or her identity. Such information may include (i) information from a successfully completed electronic check transaction, (ii) a credit report, (iii) tax documents or (iv) other similar information designed to authenticate and confirm your identity and status as an Accredited Investor or a Non-U.S. Person.</p>
          <p><strong>Specific-Qualifications Information:</strong> Investors must also provide other information sufficient to meet regulatory "suitability" requirements for investing in an Investment Opportunity presented on our Website. Depending on the nature of the offering, this information will include: (i) information concerning an Investor's net worth and income; (ii) information concerning his or her residency; and (iii) other information we might request to determine whether an Investor qualifies for a particular investment.</p>
          <p><strong>Payment Information:</strong> In order to make an investment through our Website, an Investor must provide us with certain account and other payment information, such as information needed to make payment via electronic checks, ACH or wire. Our registration process for Investors provides additional details on the types of Payment Information needed.</p>

        <h2>Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out</h2>
        
        <p>Applicable Law places certain obligations on Investors to keep information current, including, for example, Form W-9 Information. It is particularly important for you to keep your Investor Financial Information current and to report to us any material change in this Information. We use this information to provide you with investment opportunities and financial distributions due to you as an equity owner of a Investment Opportunity in which you have invested through our Website. Without current information, you receive information in error or that you are not eligible to receive or act on. To allow appropriate control over Personally Identifiable Information, you can access your account (after supplying your user name and password) to change or update discretionary information that you have previously submitted. You are entitled to decline to participate in certain Services and to decline to give us permission (or to revoke that permission in your discretion) to use your Personally Identifiable Information for certain purposes. We provide you with the ability to opt-out of receiving communications concerning, or being included in, these activities. To opt-out of Services for which an opt-out right is available, please email us at <a href="mailto:"></a>. We can also answer questions or assist if you contact us as provided herein. You will not be allowed to opt–out of required notices or other legal and related notices concerning your relationship to the Website. If you request, we will remove your name and all other Personally Identifiable Information from our databases. It may be impossible to remove this information completely, due to IRS and regulatory reporting requirements, ownership in a Investment Opportunity in which you have invested through our Website and the rights thereof, data backups and records of deletions. If you request deletion of your information, you will be unable to use certain features of the Website and any associated Services. You may not remove de-identified, anonymous, or aggregate data from our databases.</p>

We may need to share your Personally Identifiable Information with Service Providers. We will share with our Service Providers only that information necessary for them to perform their functions, and we require them to commit to refrain from using your Personally Identifiable Information for any other purpose. We may reveal your Personally Identifiable Information to attorneys, private investigator organizations or law enforcement agencies if we believe (i) that you are in risk of harm from another, (ii) that you are harming or interfering (or will harm or interfere) with others, or (iii) that you are violating (either intentionally or unintentionally) our Terms or are otherwise violating legal rights. We will take all reasonable steps to disclose only so much of this Information as is necessary, limiting the disclosure, for example (and where applicable), to Contact Information only. We will reveal your Personally Identifiable Information to the extent we reasonably believe we are required to do so by Applicable Law. If we receive legal process calling for the disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information, we will attempt to notify you at the email address you supplied during registration within a reasonable amount of time before we respond to the request, unless such notification is not permitted. We are entitled to transfer to a third party information we collect, including any Personally Identifiable Information, in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, provided the acquiring third party has agreed to safeguard your Personally Identifiable Information with protections that in all material respects are the same as, or more protective than, those set out in this Privacy Policy.

        <h2>Anonymous, Aggregate Information</h2>
        <p>We use Anonymous Information to analyze the effectiveness of our Website, to improve our Services and for other similar purposes. In addition, from time to time, we may undertake or commission statistical and other summary analyses of the general behavior and characteristics of Users participating in our Services and the characteristics of visitors to our Website and may share Anonymous Information with third parties, including advertisers. Anonymous Information provided to third parties will not allow anyone to identify you or determine anything personal about you. We may collect Anonymous Information through features of the software that supports our Services, through cookies, and through other means . We may automatically receive and record information in our server logs from your browser, including your IP address (the Internet address of your computer), your computer's name, the type and version of your web browser, referrer addresses, and other generally-accepted log information. We may also record page views and other general statistical and tracking information, which will be aggregated with that of other Users in order to understand how our Website is being used, and for security and monitoring purposes. None of this data contains Personally Identifiable Information. A cookie is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience and to make it easier for you to use a website upon a future visit. We may include cookies on our Website and use them to recognize you when you return to our Website. You may set your browser so that it does not accept cookies. However, cookies must be enabled on your web browser if you wish to access certain personalized features of our Services. We may compile records of visits with respect to certain pages or information that are available on our Website. We might also compile information and other metrics concerning Investors' interactions with respect to our Services and other features of our Website. We might compile site metrics of a page of interest or other data. Such records do not contain any Personally Identifiable Information, and all such data and information is subject to our Privacy Policy. We may use "pixel tags" to tell us what parts of our Website have been visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches Users perform on our Website. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format Users can read, and they inform us whether emails have been opened, to help ensure that our messages are of interest to our Investors. None of this data includes Personally Identifiable Information, and you can "opt-out" of receiving these types of emails from us. If any Personally Identifiable Information is collected using such tools, it will be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Our Services may include the use of ad banner partners for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. These ads may be provided, in some cases, by a third party ad service provider or advertiser. These advertisers may use traditional banner ads, or other advertising methods, such as advertising using profiles and related Content. An advertiser may place or utilize its own cookie on your browser and may use Anonymous Information about your visit to our Website, such as the number of times you have viewed the ad. If the advertiser requests that you provide to it Personally Identifiable Information, such advertiser's use and collection of such information will be governed by its own privacy policy, and not our Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the advertiser's privacy policy before providing Personally Identifiable Information. In order to determine whether your computer is supported by our system, we may collect certain Anonymous Information. This information includes, but may not be limited to, your operating system and browser, as well as the presence of any software that our Website may require to operate with your computer, or other third party software on your computer. This information is kept strictly confidential and is not shared with third parties, except as provided herein. </p>
